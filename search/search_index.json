A philosophical framework to define what constitutes good or bad use of the system. In other words: a set of abstract yet rigorously justified core objectives. A model of reality that is faithful to the truth, and can predict the future. Actionable commands that abide by the framework, and are likely to achieve the core objectives given the reality model. A system to execute the commands. A feedback system to monitor if the execution of commands has obtained the objectives. Before we dive deeper into the dependencies, let's also define the \"rules of engagement\" that the CIO must abide by. These are defined in the organizational constitution. This is separate from the philosophical framework. The difference between the two is that the framework tells us what we should do , whereas the constitution tell us how we should do it .","title":"Dependencies"},{"location":"pages/about/introduction/","text":"It is not affiliated with the US Government.

The engineers of this ephemeral automaton have designed it in such a way that it can accept linguistic commands as inputs, and independently act to realize the associated objectives. If the interface were a command line, directives one might pass to the system could include: > Reduce drug dependence in the population of opiate addicts. > Replace youth social media addiction with creative passion. > Increase levels of physical exercise across the general population. Several months after running the commands, you would begin to see these changes manifest around you in society. Of course, fully automating such a system is (probably) beyond the scope of our current capabilities, but in theory building it may still be possible by fusing intelligent technology and human general intelligence. The CIO is an attempt to realize this vision. This is all quite abstract however. Let's define the dependencies required to meet the objective.","title":"Thought experiment"},{"location":"pages/contribution/principles/","text":"","title":"Principles"},{"location":"pages/home/contact/","text":".md-typeset h1, .md-content__button { display: none; } Work in progress...","title":"Contact"},{"location":"pages/home/sponsor/","text":".md-typeset h1, .md-content__button { display: none; } At the moment the project is maintained by one student . If you would like to sponsor the project, you can do so here . Fund Utilization The funds will be used to pay for the costs of operating the organization. This includes or may include: domain maintenance costs, obsidian publish site costs, AWS and hosting costs, GitHub Actions costs, and so on. In the spirit of radical transparency I plan to make the expenses, inflows, and contributors available in a public repository, where they will be regularly updated. I will update this message once that repository is available. Legal Status To be clear, this is not a legal entity - it is purely an abstraction around a project I have wanted to work on for some time. At the moment between school, work, and the general maintenance of homeostasis, I don't have the energy to figure out how to incorporate and manage a corporation. Accordingly, in the current structure, any funds contributed will be reported as non-employee compensation on the 1099-NEC when I submit my taxes. This may change in the future if I decide to implement my original plan to incorporate for the purpose of offering specific services, though this would be an adjacent entity.","title":"Sponsor"},{"location":"pages/todo/api/","text":"","title":"Api"},{"location":"pages/todo/dashboard/","text":"","title":"Dashboard"}]}
