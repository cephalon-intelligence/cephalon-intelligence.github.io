# Why is it called "Cephalon"?
* domain name (io is best)
* cephalon is a head, and because it generally refers to the head of an athropod, the cephalon is anatomically (in the case of the arthropod) and metaphorically (in the case of the organization) a shield for the mind
* wanted a word that starts with "C" - had a bit of fun with mirroring the CIA - but it's important there is no relation I'm just having fun
