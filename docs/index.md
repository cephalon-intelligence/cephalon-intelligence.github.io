The [CIO](https://github.com/cephalon-intelligence) is an [open source intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) organization. It is not affiliated with the US Government, and is maintained and primarily developed by a cognitive science [student](https://www.github.com/harttraveller). The project is still in its infancy, and accordingly it can be expected to continuously evolve.
