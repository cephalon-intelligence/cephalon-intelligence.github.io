At the moment the project is maintained by one [student](https://www.github.com/harttraveller). If you would like to sponsor the project, you can do so [here](https://github.com/sponsors/harttraveller).

**Fund Utilization**

The funds will be used to pay for the costs of operating the organization. This includes or may include: domain maintenance costs, obsidian publish site costs, AWS and hosting costs, GitHub Actions costs, and so on. In the spirit of [radical transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_transparency) I plan to make the expenses, inflows, and contributors available in a public repository, where they will be regularly updated. I will update this message once that repository is available.

**Legal Status**

To be clear, this is not a legal entity - it is purely an abstraction around a project I have wanted to work on for some time. At the moment between school, work, and the general maintenance of homeostasis, I don't have the energy to figure out how to incorporate and manage a corporation. Accordingly, in the current structure, any funds contributed will be reported as [non-employee compensation](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/tax-information-for-github-sponsors) on the [1099-NEC](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-nec) when I submit my taxes. This may change in the future if I decide to implement my original plan to incorporate for the purpose of offering specific services, though this would be an adjacent entity.
