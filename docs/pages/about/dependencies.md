To realize this vision, there are five primary dependencies.

1. A philosophical framework to define what constitutes good or bad use of the system. In other words: a set of abstract yet rigorously justified core objectives.
2. A model of reality that is faithful to the truth, and can predict the future.
3. Actionable commands that abide by the framework, and are likely to achieve the core objectives given the reality model.
4. A system to execute the commands.
5. A feedback system to monitor if the execution of commands has obtained the objectives.

Before we dive deeper into the dependencies, let's also define the "rules of engagement" that the CIO must abide by. These are defined in the organizational constitution. This is separate from the philosophical framework. The difference between the two is that the framework tells us *what we should do*, whereas the constitution tell us *how we should do it*.
