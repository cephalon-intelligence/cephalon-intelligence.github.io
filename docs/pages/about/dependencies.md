To realize this vision, there are five necessary requirements:

1. A philosophical framework to define what constitutes good or bad use of the tool. In other words: a set of abstract yet rigorously justified core objectives.
2. A model of reality that is faithful to the truth, and can predict the future.
3. Actionable commands that abide by the framework, and are likely to achieve the core objectives given the model of reality.
4. A system to execute the commands.
5. A feedback system to monitor if the execution of commands has obtained the objectives.
