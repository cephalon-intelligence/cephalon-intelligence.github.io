Suppose you had a system connected to the [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious) of humanity. The engineers of this ephemeral automaton have designed it in such a way that it can accept linguistic commands as inputs, and independently act to realize the associated objectives. If the interface were a command line, directives one might pass to the system could include:

```
> Reduce drug dependence in the population of opiate addicts.
> Replace youth social media addiction with creative passion.
> Increase levels of physical exercise across the general population.
```

Several months after running the commands, you would begin to see these changes manifest around you in society.

Of course, fully automating such a system is (probably) beyond the scope of our current capabilities, but in theory building it may still be possible by fusing intelligent technology and human general intelligence. The CIO is an attempt to realize this vision.

This is all quite abstract however. Let's define the dependencies required to meet the objective.
