Suppose that you had a system connected to the [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious) of society. This hypothetical automaton has been designed such that given a discrete command, it can independently act to realize the associated objective. Optimally, one could interface with the system through a command line capable of interpreting natural language. Commands one might pass could include:

```
> Reduce the drug dependence in opiate addicts.
> Raise the interest level in STEM in high school students.
> Increase general levels of physical exercise across the population.
```

Several months after passing in the commands, you would begin to see these changes manifest in society around you.

Of course, fully automating such a system is (probably) beyond the scope of our current capabilities, but in theory building it may still be possible by fusing intelligent technology and human general intelligence. The CIO is an attempt to realize this system.
