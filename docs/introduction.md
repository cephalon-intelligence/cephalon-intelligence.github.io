Suppose you had a system connected to the [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious) of humanity. The engineers of this ephemeral automaton have designed it such that it can accept linguistic commands as inputs, and independently act to realize the associated objectives. If the interface were a command line, directives one might pass to the system could include:

```
> Reduce the drug dependence in opiate addicts.
> Raise the level of interest in STEM in high school students.
> Increase general levels of physical exercise across the population.
```

Several months after passing in the commands, you would begin to see these changes manifest in society around you.

Of course, fully automating such a system is (probably) beyond the scope of our current capabilities, but in theory building it may still be possible by fusing intelligent technology and human general intelligence. The CIO is an attempt to realize this system.
